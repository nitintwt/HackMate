# HackMate

HackMate is a place where you can find teammates for your next hackathon.

All you have to do is search for the hackathon you're participating. If someone else is also looking for teammates, you can team up. Or, you can make your own post asking for teammates. Just mention the date and name of the hackathon, and what skills you need in teammates.

After you post it, other users can apply, and you can see all applied users list in your profile section. Then, you can pick the best one based on their profiles. Once you accept, you can see their contact details. There is still some upgrade left, will work on it.

# But how did I come up with this idea? 
Because I had faced this problem. So, in January, I was looking for teammates to participate in Diversion hackathon. I tried to contact many people, but there wasn't an easy way to do it.

I was messaging people on Discord, but couldn't find anyone. Because of this, I couldn't participate in the hackathon. It was supposed to be my first one, and I was really excited to meet new people and build something cool with a team. But it didn't happen.

Then, in March, there was another hackathon at NIT Rourkela, and I couldn't participate for the same reason. That's where I got the idea for this project.
But first, I messaged the Devfolio founder on Twitter about this problem and suggested a feature for it,but I didn't get a response. I also emailed Devfolio, but still no answer.

And then I thought: Fine, I'll do it myself
